Goal for blog, why am I writing?
To learn, clarify thoughts, develop articulation and critical thinking skills.
(Attract an audience, self promote, maybe market in future)

I want to force myself to write regularly. Weekly, to publish a personal magazine which can include:

1. Article - has to be something I would send to Dave to review.
2. What I learned css/js/web tech/design tech/personal
3. Pick of the week: book, podcast, blog post, activity, movie, website.
4. Photo of the week

## Intro/The Setup/Preface

* Explain where my questioning starting, when I realised I didn' know how to evaluate a visual style, and why this is important. (maybe reasons can be implicit)

I realised that I've expressed an opinion on a current design trend several times, but am not sure if I can actually put my words into practice. A client recently stated they love the flat design thing. And I had no retort. I asked why, 'because it's hot right now and looks great done right'. ok, and then I couldn't counter with a good reason to explore to invest in exploring other styles, or think of reasons the trend might be inappropriate, beyond a feeling that it was the right thing to do.On the topic of whether said trend is good/bad/right to use/what's my opinion. I've retorted with 'trends are just an option which is popular at the moment, doesn't make it good or bad, if the style is right for a project, that's the indicator'. It seems fundemental to be able to define the right style for a project to communicate our work in the right way, and to know we're making the best decisions.

## On trends, caveats, bubble

Of course there are things to consider, like over popularity. But what do I even mean by that... That if you choose a visual style for the right reasons, but it happens to be trending, then you could sucumbe to the fact that users perception will change based on over popularity and it's resulting lack of originality and increasing banality, even though you actually made the right 'timeless' decision? Although it feels like there is a grain of ideology with good intent there, there also exists an alternate universe in which the right design style triumphs over the evil of the trend, and users are so enlightened as to appreciate the shallow sways in popularity for what they really are and appreciate and understand the designers masterful work objectively.

Well... In that world designers also their designer tool of choice high over head and shout 'by the power of greyskull'

What about the trend. Clients want flat. It's current and cool. It makes them look good, like a new in fashion suit. Considerations are the bursting bubble as we get bored of that style. But timed right, maybe that's ok. An argument can be made for longevity, timeless design sounds like such a beautiful ideal. The website is more valuable... it will last for years. But there are many more things to consider in web design than visual style. Techonology. new browser capabilities. new devices. The ideal of timeless style in print doesn't perhaps exist on the web. A 5 year update cycle might be not just acceptable, but good.

Not Tan's site, timeless flatness.

Originality in the trend. Vs copying. (Don't steal sheep?) Taking inspiration vs copying. Lack of thought, input, research.

Getting back to the question though.

## Sources of choices for style; personal/signature style/flair, historical, topic

How do you discover, choose the right visual style? Personal, trend, influenced by history of company/client/topic.

Personal, some people want spiekermann do do his thing (EJS video). Massimo Vignelli has a style for sure, the autheur of his work. Jesica Hische (maybe), olly moss. They have styles, arguably. Sagemeister? Happy Cog.

Maybe touch on examples for other choices.

## Going with the trend, how to decide. Is the trend appropriate?

When is it right to go with a trend? If customers love the style and it's early in the trend (however you measure that) maybe it will be good for a client and increase sales or popularity, or whatever the key metric is. Kids website? Medical. Education. Banks. China. Africa. Historical museum. (site inappropriate flat uses) (nice but doesn't really work. People doing African sites are probably designing to their trends, like we're not taking inspiration from China) What are the keywords asociated with the trend, what message does it communicate, what message do you want to communicate.

## Trend behaviour, 

How do they end? Examples, did one die, or was is succeeded, can one die without a succeesor, or are they connected and inversely proportional?

How do trends start? Examples

## Conclusion

Using that info can help make better decisions and help influence clients. How can we start the next trend? Should that ever be the goal? Should we avoiding trends be the goal? The key is making good decisions. Not accepting what's cool. Conscious consideration. Care for what we are communicating.
