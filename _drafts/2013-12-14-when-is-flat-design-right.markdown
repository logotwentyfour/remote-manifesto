What new thing am I talking about? Talking to clients about trends? The process of qualification, examples.

## Intro/The Setup/Preface

* Explain where my questioning starting, when I realised I didn' know how to evaluate a visual style, and why this is important. (maybe reasons can be implicit)

My take on visual design trends has been that they are just popular options. A a trending style isn't necessarily good or bad, if the style is right for a project, it's right. It seems fundamental to be able to define the right style for a project to communicate our message in the right way, and to know we're making the best decisions, but I found myself doubting my judgement for the right visual design for a recent project, in particular how to evaluate a client's request to make all the things flat, and to argue.

## On trends, caveats, bubble

Of course there are things to consider, like over popularity. That if you choose a visual style for the right reasons, but it happens to be trending, then you could sucumbe to the fact that users perception will change based on over popularity and it's resulting lack of originality and increasing banality, even though you actually made the right 'timeless' decision? Although it feels like there is a grain of ideology with good intent there, there also exists an alternate universe in which the right design style triumphs over the possible evils of a trend, and users are so enlightened as to appreciate the shallow sways in popularity for what they really are and appreciate and understand the designers masterful work objectively. The right choice is with consideration to trend behaviour.

In this alternate utopian world, designers regularly raise their pencils high over head and shout 'by the power of greyskull. I have the aesthetic!'

A client wants the ambiguous flat ui. It's current and cool, but perhaps not the best choice. I reached out to a few designers I admire for their thoughts on process for developing style and how to communicate with clients that come with a priscription.

Trent said to ask 'Why'

I thought about the argument for timelessness. Massimo's work comes to mind. And this web site. One of my favourite's. Also the 24ways site... sham. (archive)

Not Tan's site, timeless flatness. or personal taste?

Originality in the trend. Vs copying. (Don't steal sheep?) Taking inspiration vs copying. Lack of thought, input, research.

Getting back to the question though.

## Sources of choices for style; personal/signature style/flair, historical, topic

How do you discover, choose the right visual style? Personal, trend, influenced by history of company/client/topic.

Personal, some people want spiekermann do do his thing (EJS video). Massimo Vignelli has a style for sure, the autheur of his work. Jesica Hische (maybe), olly moss. They have styles, arguably. Sagemeister? Happy Cog.

Maybe touch on examples for other choices.

## Going with the trend, how to decide. Is the trend appropriate?

When is it right to go with a trend? If customers love the style and it's early in the trend (however you measure that) maybe it will be good for a client and increase sales or popularity, or whatever the key metric is. Kids website? Medical. Education. Banks. China. Africa. Historical museum. (site inappropriate flat uses) (nice but doesn't really work. People doing African sites are probably designing to their trends, like we're not taking inspiration from China) What are the keywords asociated with the trend, what message does it communicate, what message do you want to communicate.

## Trend behaviour, 

How do they end? Examples, did one die, or was is succeeded, can one die without a succeesor, or are they connected and inversely proportional?

How do trends start? Examples

## Conclusion

Using that info can help make better decisions and help influence clients. How can we start the next trend? Should that ever be the goal? Should we avoiding trends be the goal? The key is making good decisions. Not accepting what's cool. Conscious consideration. Care for what we are communicating.

Hi Mark,

I’m a long time admirer, Gridset fan and Five Simple Steps reader. If you have a minute I’d love to pick your brain about process for creating , or deciding on, a project’s visual  style.

I’m collecting my thoughts by writing a post on the topic with the aim of being better at communicating to clients why the current oblate trend in our industry may, or may not, be the right choice for their project – I have had a few new clients recently tell me they want “flat design”. Being able to better communicate are the topic, I feel, will be invaluable in future also, not just for the trend of the hour.

If you have a minute to share your thoughts, or can think of any resources that may be useful, it would be much appreciated. I’m sure you’re up to your eyes as usual though, so if you don’t have time to reply I completely understand.

Have a great Chrismas,
@Paddy

[16/12/2013 17:11:43] Trent Walton: That word is so subjective.
[16/12/2013 17:12:03] Trent Walton: talk to clients about WHY they want a particular style… it's more about the right tool for the right job
[16/12/2013 17:12:34] Trent Walton: but I'd say that when clients say RESPONSIVE FLAT CSS3 HTML5 CANVAS OMG, they don't mean anything in particular other than "we want something current".

Dave: 
Regarding flat design, I think visual styling is something that is very project-specific. It seems like an obvious statement but in certain cases a minimal design may not suit.

There’ll always be people who want the latest trends, and that’s okay. I think the best way to approach these things is to have a solid base of a good grid, good typography, and suitable imagery. Once you have those, you can dress up or dress down the style accordingly.

As with anything, moderation is the key. Not too flat, not too texture-heavy.

Kilian:

I’ve always tended towards the flatter style, even in college. I was a type man through and through so most of my work (after the grungey distorted phase that I went through at the very beginning before college) was trying to be minimalist.

As for choosing whether to use it on a project, I tend to think through a couple of things. 

If the audience or feeling off the product or service is supposed to be fun it can sometimes make sense to incorporate more skeuomorphic elements for emphasis, if the interface should be noticed vs dissolving away and getting out of the users way.

As far as trends, if I think the particular device is useful for conveying the message I say why not go with a trend. Sometimes these things are trends because they are flashy, but other times they’re trends because they solve a problem that we’ve had for a long while and it does it nicely/elegantly. I’ve become partial to the height: 100% on the first container as it gives a consistent experience to all users who visit that page regardless of browser height. Things like parallax to me are a pain in the ass as a user. I’ve never used it and there might be 3 examples I’ve ever enjoyed and that were used to good effect.


Jon:

Hi Paddy,

4. I haven’t written about my thoughts, or even documented my own process, and yet, that’s the answer in my mind: Design is a process, not a product. The aesthetic is an output of that process: the best fit for:

a. The experience required to meet organisational objectives (enacted versus emergent narrative)
b. The context of use and content (designing for impact or immersion, or both), 
c. The audience (mental models, historical cultural landscape, and expectations)

That’s not a comprehensive, or prioritised list by any means, but may give you some idea of my thinking here. If any of this seems confusing, please feel free to ask questions. I’ll try and respond fast!

I can’t think of ny resources right at this moment.

Good luck with the piece and thanks again!

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics - For Francis Hutcheson beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like Henry Home, Lord Kames, William Hogarth, and Edmund Burke hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye on "a wanton kind of chase"; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of psychology (such as James Mill) or biology (such as Herbert Spencer).
