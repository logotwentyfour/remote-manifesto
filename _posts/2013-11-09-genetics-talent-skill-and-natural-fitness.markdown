I’ve heard statements similar to these several times throughout my life and they’ve stuck in my mind, probably because they frustrate the heck out of me.

<blockquote>“I can’t learn guitar, because I have small fingers.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I would be terrible at climbing, because I have no upperbody strength.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m bad at languages.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m too old to learn, kids just soak it up like sponges.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s easy for them, they are naturally fit.”</blockquote>

# Physical Limitations

playing guitar doesn't require long fingers. Malmsteen has short chubby fingers, he's one of the best. Black Sabbath's guitar player, Tony Iommi, fashioned a prostethic finger from washing up liquid bottles.

Short fingers may be an issue for some incredibly wide reaches. Maybe it makes it more challenging to be one of the most accomplished lead guitarists in the world, but probably not. Anyone, lucky enough to have most of their fingers can learn a few open chords, and so play guitar. . The physical limitation is an excuse.

The same with climbing. Most people, in reasonably good health, could manage an easy sports climb. Some easy climbs are like stair cases, with very little stress placed on the arms. I imagine for many, climbing conjures a single image or emotion. Climbing equals difficult. The definition of the task or new skill is important. What does climbing or playing guitar mean? Does a person want to climb a ladder, or Dura Dura? Does another want to play Teen Spirit, or Yngwie Malmsteen's Black Ship?

A fear of heights is different type of challenge, or a more valid excuse. In both cases, guitar and climbing, I'm referring to someone who would actually like to learn. If there's no desire, than excuses and inaction are irrelevant.

# Language and Learning in General

What about languages? I completely disqualify the statement that kids are better at learning. Perhaps brain functioning is better in early years, particularly when compare to the later years of an average human life—I’m sure there are scientific reports to prove or disprove my opinion-based ramble—but, I believe the skill of learning generally increases over time, or can increase. So as we mature, if we decide, we can become more aware of our process for learning and create a system and environment to learn quickly.

The idea that some people are bad at languages too seems a little flakey. It's too easy to say “I'm bad at languages”. Another excuse. “I'm bad, therefore I do not have to try”.

# Skill vs Talent

For sure some seem to more naturally excel at certain areas, people we say are “talented”. And the conditioning of a lifetime of habits can greatly influence how easy it is to adopt a new skill. For example gymnastics, if you have a history of doing sport or exercise involving strength and good coordination, it will most likely help.

Desire however, can compensate seeming lack of talent. If you want something enough, there is more often than not a way to make it happen. The desire drives the effort, or in challenging cases, the hard work, patience and perseverance to learn a new skill or reach a goal.

I love Will Smith’s answer, when asked about the difference between him, about reaching his level success and if he is talented. He says:

<blockquote>“Talent only helps so much, they you have develop skill...The difference between me is sickening, sickening work ethic.”</blockquote>

# Natural Fitness
I remember vividly the last time I heard this. At a networking event, during a presentation given by sports supplement company, who were advising a healthy diet and regular exercise as part of their diet.

It turned out on guy at the meeting regularly runs Iron Man triathlon’s. It’s like his hobby, he loves them. Another then commented that this athlete was naturally fit, as was a neigbour who could run 5k with ease.

To describe my reaction, flabergausted comes to mind. Whatever slight genetic advantage one might have, to believe in natural fitness is to believe that you are either naturally fit, or naturally unfit. The athlete trains for triathlons and probably eats quite well. Those events demand attention to nutrition or the body will not perform. The same, I imagine, is true for the doubters neighbour. She probably exercises somewhat and eats ok at least.

It's highly unlikely that the gentlemen who implied running 5k was beyond him, and that eating healthily was wasted, has very similar physical activity and eating habits as the triathlete or neighbour, but that he is the victim of some genetic injustice that makes him naturally unheathly. Naturally healthy is another excuse, a very convenient and solid one, especially when you like to be stationary and eat sweets. (rant over)

Excuses
This post could have been titled 'Excuses'. It's easy to point self-limiting excuses of people I've met, and to counter those with things, climbing, fitness, languages, that I'm doing OK with, with my hobbies. My aim though is to raise awareness of self-imposed limitations, and then to probe at them a bit.

What is something you would love to do, or learn to do? What new habits would you like to instill? Are there any excuses floating around blocking them, and if so are they really valid?

# Self Reflection

When deciding the purpose of writing this article, I came up with a couple of things. One was to experiment with a more informal writing style, and to write something that was purely opinion-based without overly concerning myself with factual validation. A second was a little more grandiose, hoping maybe one person was shake off an excuse and try something they've been putting off.

The third, and probably the root of the desire to write abou this topic, which has been naggin at me for a couple of weeks now, is to identify my own current excuses.

I've been trying to gain weight for about six months, but have stayed more or less the same. Why? Not eating enough consistently, and not training to gain weight consistently. Excuses? I don't have time because during very busy work periods. I have to spend more on food, and it's a vanity goal, so.... There is clearly a way to make it happen though.

I've been trying to meditate regularly also, and can say I do so, but not with 100% consistency, I miss a week here or there, particularly during busy work periods. Same excuse.

# Motivation

Tony Robbins encourages using a question I like, around goal setting. Using his two direction, pleasure and pain, methaphor for why we take action or not, pleasure is usually clearly defined in the reason for the pursuit of the new thing we're undertaking. The pleasure motivates us to take action towards the goal. What can supplement that, is to define the pain that will be received by not following through. So the question, for my own self-assigned homework. As well as another business goal.

“What will happen if I don’t take action and make these things happen? What will the concequences be?”
