## Compass and Grunt

Do 'grunt' in the site folder, from terminal before deploying to GitHub Pages.

### CSS

* Run compass watch in the css folder, and run grunt watch in the root folder.
* When main.scss is updated compass generates css/build/main.css
* When that file is created, grunt runs autoprefix and creates css/build/autoprefix/main.css
* When that file is created, grunt runs cssmin and creates css/main.css (product ready, and in the right location for layouts/default.html to pick up)

### JS

* js/main.js and js/plugins.js are being concatenated and minified with 'grunt', they're not included in 'grunt watch'. Add other js files in Gruntfile.js.

### Image Opimisation

Grunt is also watching to optimise images.
