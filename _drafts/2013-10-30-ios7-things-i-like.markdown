* Airplane Mode access from the new control centre is great. I keep my phone on Airplane Mode whenever it’s in my pocket, and at night, so it’s very nice to switch to quickly.
* The camera is so fast!
* The irritating little photo-video toggle is no more, fixing probably the worst design decision of the previous iOS.
* Controlling audio playback from control centre is also nice. About 90% of the time I’m between destinations, I am listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or at the moment, a [Spanish](http://remotemanifesto.com/experiment/2013/10/20/spanish-in-30-days-conclusion.html "Read the conclusion of my experiment to learn Spanish in 30 days") audio course. Before I had to double-tap the home icon from the lock screen, which was the most annoying iPhone gesture.
* The Flashlight button from control centre also makes me happy, although I haven’t needed it yet. I’ve installed several “flashlight” apps in the past which just uselessly made my screen white.
* The new minimal scroll in Safari is nice.

The list isn’t comprehensive, but these are the things that come most easily to mind and make me happy.
