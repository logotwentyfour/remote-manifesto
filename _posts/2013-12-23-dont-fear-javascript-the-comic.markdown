Our story starts with an unlikely hero. A young designer with the desire to learn to code; in particular to unlock the mysterious wonders of a foreign language known only as — suspenseful pause — JavaScript.

Self-doubt and a cloudy picture of our hero’s true destiny plague him as we join his story&hellip;

    <p><span class="panel-01-01"><i>Hero: </i>Man, I’m sick of limiting myself to jQuery examples</span> <span class="panel-01-02">but being more adventureous, writing some straight up JavaScript&hellip; that’s scary stuff</span></p>

    <p><span class="panel-04-02"><i>Hero: </i>YES!</span> <span class="panel-04-03">That felt a little overexcited and involuntary</span></p>

## Outro

Our hero over came personal limitations and ridiculous expectations, realising that knowing JavaScript, or to code in general, is more of a journey than a destination.

## Personal conclusions on learning to code

* Be brave and break stuff.
* Pick a book or course, get a recommendation, and do that. Avoid paralysis by analysis, the best learning is in doing.
* Reach out and find a JS buddy to bounce questions off.
* Start to make something. Make something you want, something small or big, doesn’t matter. Make it wrong, learn from mistakes, just try something and ask a buddy to review.
* The [JS Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/) podcast is awesome.

I really enjoyed these articles from [24 Ways](http://24ways.org/), about learning JavaScript, and to code:

* [Levelling Up](http://24ways.org/2013/levelling-up/)
* [JavaScript: Taking Off the Training Wheels](http://24ways.org/2013/javascript-taking-off-the-training-wheels/)

I did my best to make this little story semantic, accessible and responsive.
