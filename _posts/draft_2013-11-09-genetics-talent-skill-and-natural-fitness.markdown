<blockquote>“I can’t learn guitar, because I have small fingers.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I would be terrible at climbing, because I have no upperbody strength.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m bad at languages.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m too old to learn, kids just soak it up like sponges.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s easy for them, they are naturally fit.”</blockquote>

I’ve heard statements similar to these several times throughout my life—not directed at me—and they’ve stuck in my mind, probably because they frustrate the heck out of me. That is, they frustrate me if the person doing the talking really wants to do something, but has setup excuses for not taking action.

### Physical Limitations

Playing guitar doesn’t require long fingers. [Yngwie Malmsteen](#) has short chubby fingers and he’s one of the best. Black Sabbath guitarist, [Tony Iommi](#), fashioned a prostethic finger from washing up liquid bottles after an accident, which is a much more serious obstacle than small fingers. And guitars come with different width necks. The physical limitation is just an excuse. If you want it, you can do it.

The situation is similar with rock climbing. Most people, in reasonably good health, could manage an easy sports route. Some easy climbs are like stair cases, with very little stress placed on the arms. I imagine for many, climbing conjures a single image or emotion. Climbing equals difficult.

### Goal Definition

The definition of what acquiring a new skill means is important. What does climbing or playing guitar mean? Does a person want to climb a ladder, or [Dura Dura](#)? Does another want to play [Teen Spirit](#), or Malmsteen’s [Black Ship](#)? Defining a goal can often demystify what is involved in achieving it, removing some of the associated fear. 

### Learning with Age

What about languages? I completely disqualify the statement that kids are better at learning. Perhaps brain functioning is better in early years, particularly when compare to the later years of an average human life—I’m sure there are scientific reports to prove or disprove my opinion-based ramble—but, I believe the skill of learning generally increases over time, or can increase. So as we mature, if we decide, we can become more aware of our process for learning and create a system and environment to learn quicker and better.

### Previous Experience

The conditioning of a lifetime of habits can greatly influence how easy it is to adopt a new skill. For example gymnastics, if you have a history of doing sport or exercise involving strength and coordination, it will most likely help. If you have already learned several languages it gives an advantage, especially learning one in a family you are familiar with. If you can play several instruments, understanding music will greatly help learning another.

### Skill vs Talent

For sure some seem to more naturally excel in certain areas. People we say are “talented”. Desire however, can compensate seeming lack of talent. If you want something enough, there is more often than not a way to make it happen. The desire drives the effort, or in challenging cases, the hard work, patience and perseverance, to learn a new skill.

I love Will Smith’s answer, when asked about the difference between him, about reaching his level success and if he is talented. He says:

<blockquote>“Talent only helps so much, they you have develop skill...The difference between me is sickening, sickening work ethic.”</blockquote>

### Natural Fitness

I remember vividly the last time I heard this. At a networking event, during a presentation given by sports supplement company, who were advising a healthy diet and regular exercise as part of their diet.

It turned out one meeting attendee regularly runs Iron Man triathlon’s. It’s his hobby, he loves them. Another then commented that this athlete was naturally fit, as was a neighbour who could run 5km with ease.

Whatever slight genetic health advantage one might have, to believe in natural fitness is to believe that you are either naturally fit, or naturally unfit. The athlete trains for triathlons and probably eats well. Those events demand attention to nutrition or the body will not perform. The same, I imagine, is true for the doubter’s neighbour. She probably exercises somewhat and eats relatively well.

It’s highly unlikely that the gentlemen who implied running 5km was too much for him, has very similar physical activity and eating habits as the triathlete or neighbour, but that he is the victim of some genetic injustice that makes him naturally unheathly.

Natural health is another excuse, a very convenient and solid one, especially if you like to be stationary and eat sweets—end rant.

### Excuses

This post could be titled “Excuses”. It’s easy to point self-limiting excuses of people I’ve overheard at times, and to counter those with examples of, more or less, my hobbies; climbing, health and fitness, languages. My aim though is to draw a little attention to possible self-imposed limitations, and then to probe at them a bit.

What is something you would love to do, or learn to do? What new habits would you like to instill? Are there any excuses floating around blocking them, and if so are they really valid?

### Self Reflection

When deciding why I felt the desire to write this post, I came up with few answers. One was to experiment with a more informal writing style, and to write something that was purely opinion-based without overly concerning myself with factual validation. A second was a little more grandiose, hoping maybe one person was shake off an excuse and try something they’ve been putting off.

The third, and probably the real root of the desire to write about this topic—which has been nagging at me for a couple of weeks now—is to identify my own current excuses.

I’ve been trying to gain weight for about six months, but have stayed more or less the same. Why? Not eating enough consistently, and not training to gain weight consistently. Excuses? I don’t have time because during very busy work periods. I have to spend more on food, and it’s a vanity goal, so.... There is clearly a way to make it happen though.

I’ve been trying to meditate regularly also, and can say I do meditate, but not with 100% consistency, I miss a week here or there, particularly during busy work periods—Same excuse.

### Motivation

Tony Robbins encourages using a question when goal setting. I’ll make use of his two direction, pleasure and pain, methaphor for why we take action or not. Pleasure is usually clearly defined in the reason for the pursuit of the new goal we’re undertaking. The pleasure motivates us to take action towards the goal; what will we get if we achieve it? What can supplement that, is to define the pain that will be received by not following through. So the question I need to answer, for my own self-assigned homework:

“What will happen if I don’t take action and make these things happen? What will the concequences be?”
