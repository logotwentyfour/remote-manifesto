[16/12/2013 17:11:43] Trent Walton: That word is so subjective.
[16/12/2013 17:12:03] Trent Walton: talk to clients about WHY they want a particular style… it's more about the right tool for the right job
[16/12/2013 17:12:34] Trent Walton: but I'd say that when clients say RESPONSIVE FLAT CSS3 HTML5 CANVAS OMG, they don't mean anything in particular other than "we want something current".

Dave: 
Regarding flat design, I think visual styling is something that is very project-specific. It seems like an obvious statement but in certain cases a minimal design may not suit.

There’ll always be people who want the latest trends, and that’s okay. I think the best way to approach these things is to have a solid base of a good grid, good typography, and suitable imagery. Once you have those, you can dress up or dress down the style accordingly.

As with anything, moderation is the key. Not too flat, not too texture-heavy.

Kilian:

I’ve always tended towards the flatter style, even in college. I was a type man through and through so most of my work (after the grungey distorted phase that I went through at the very beginning before college) was trying to be minimalist.

As for choosing whether to use it on a project, I tend to think through a couple of things. 

If the audience or feeling off the product or service is supposed to be fun it can sometimes make sense to incorporate more skeuomorphic elements for emphasis, if the interface should be noticed vs dissolving away and getting out of the users way.

As far as trends, if I think the particular device is useful for conveying the message I say why not go with a trend. Sometimes these things are trends because they are flashy, but other times they’re trends because they solve a problem that we’ve had for a long while and it does it nicely/elegantly. I’ve become partial to the height: 100% on the first container as it gives a consistent experience to all users who visit that page regardless of browser height. Things like parallax to me are a pain in the ass as a user. I’ve never used it and there might be 3 examples I’ve ever enjoyed and that were used to good effect.


Jon:

Hi Paddy,

4. I haven’t written about my thoughts, or even documented my own process, and yet, that’s the answer in my mind: Design is a process, not a product. The aesthetic is an output of that process: the best fit for:

a. The experience required to meet organisational objectives (enacted versus emergent narrative)
b. The context of use and content (designing for impact or immersion, or both), 
c. The audience (mental models, historical cultural landscape, and expectations)

That’s not a comprehensive, or prioritised list by any means, but may give you some idea of my thinking here. If any of this seems confusing, please feel free to ask questions. I’ll try and respond fast!

I can’t think of ny resources right at this moment.

Good luck with the piece and thanks again!
