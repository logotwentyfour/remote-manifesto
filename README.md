# [The Remote Manifesto](http://remotemanifesto.com)

## Firing up the dev environment

Run `jekyll serve --watch` in the root folder.

## Grunt & Deploy!

Stop `grunt watch` and run `grunt` in the root folder to min and concatenate js, as well as optimise images.

## Compass and Grunt CSS

* Run `compass watch` in the css folder, and run `grunt watch` in the root folder.
* When main.scss is updated compass generates css/build/main.css
* When that file is created, grunt runs autoprefix and creates css/build/autoprefix/main.css
* When that file is created, grunt runs cssmin and creates css/main.css (product ready, and in the right location for layouts/default.html to pick up)

## Grunt JS

* js/main.js and js/plugins.js are being concatenated and minified with 'grunt', they're not included in 'grunt watch'. Add other js files in Gruntfile.js.

## Grunt Image Opimisation

Grunt optimises all images in the assets folder.
