I had just bought new socks. It was raining. The bus stop had shelter, which was nice. I was listening to a [podcast](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/my-new-book-exclusive-the-choose-yourself-stories/ "The James Altucher Show") which prompted me to buy a book. I took out my iPhone and noted the steps that brought me to that purchase decision.

A few weeks back, Tim Ferriss shared a link on Facebook, to James Altucher’s article, “[33 Unusual Tips to Being a Better Writer](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/03/33-unusual-tips-to-being-a-better-writer)”. It was my introduction to Altucher. I’m trying to improve my writing—both the quality and quantity of it—and I’m a big Tim Ferris fan, so the post caught my attention.

The 33 Tips article is great. I applied a few of the points to a [post](http://remotemanifesto.com/code/2014/01/02/jekyll-post-specific-css-and-webfonts.html "My post, Jekyll specific CSS and web fonts for latest posts on homepage") I was writing and they worked surprisingly well.

One tip says to remove the first and last paragraph from every post, which sounds a little crazy. Even if you’re aware of the technique while writing apparently it still works. And it did.

About a week later I was watching and listening to some of the material from a Louise Hay online seminar. James Altucher’s name came up again.

I’m also a big fan of Louise Hay. I’ve read her book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0937611018/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0937611018&linkCode=as2&tag=theremomani-21" title="Pick up Louise Hay’s famous book and send me a little affiliate commission at the same time. If you like.">You Can Heal Your Life</a><img src="http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theremomani-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0937611018" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
”, watched her film by the same name, and recommend both. As with Tim Ferriss, I pay attention to what she says.

I took a lot from the interview with Altucher. I added him to my mental list of people I should pay attention to, and subscribed to his [blog](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/ "The James Altucher Blog").

From the blog, I learned of his podcast, just launched, and subscribed to it too.<sup><a href="#why-i-buy-footnote-1" id="why-i-buy-footnote-link-1">&#8224;</a></sup>

<aside class="digression" id="why-i-buy-footnote-1"><p><b>&#8224;</b> I tend to listen to more podcasts and audiobooks than I do read. Listening is ideal for filling waiting and commute times. Plus I don’t think well while I’m moving about. I sit down and write when I need to think effectively about something. So it’s not like I’m shutting out thoughts with constant noise.<a class="return-to-text" href="#why-i-buy-footnote-link-1" title="Continue reading the main text"><b>Continue reading the main text </b>&#8629;</a></p></aside>

Another week passes and Gary Vaynerchuk is the interviewee on Altucher’s podcast. Gary has just published his third book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/006227306X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=006227306X&linkCode=as2&tag=theremomani-21" title="Pick up Vaynerchuk’s new book and send me a little affiliate commission at the same time. If you like.">Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook: How to Tell Your Story in a Noisy, Social World</a><img src="http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theremomani-21&l=as2&o=2&a=006227306X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />”, which James loves.


Along with improving my writing, I want to promote myself better and shape my personal brand.<sup><a href="#why-i-buy-footnote-2" id="why-i-buy-footnote-link-2">&#8225;</a></sup>

<aside class="tangent" id="why-i-buy-footnote-2"><p><b>&#8225;</b> At the moment, this blog is somewhat scattered. I write on topics from very specific technical ones, like [text editors](http://remotemanifesto.com/productivity/2014/01/27/sublime-text-search-file-type.html "Sublime Text search by file type"), to others like [language learning](http://remotemanifesto.com/experiments/2013/09/10/spanish-in-30-days-experiment-introduction.html "The Spanish-in-30-Days Experiment: Introduction"), [Russian tractors]("My Inspiring Russian Grandfather-in-law and his Six Wheel Drive Potato Harvesting Machine"), and [JavaScript comics](http://remotemanifesto.com/code/2013/12/23/dont-fear-javascript-the-comic.html "Don’t Fear JavaScript: The Comic"). All things I want to write about. But, if I want this site to be more than a personal journal, I probably need to narrow my focus, or at least write to several places with specific audiences in mind. <a class="return-to-text" href="#why-i-buy-footnote-link-2" title="Continue reading the main text"><b>Continue reading the main text </b>&#8629;</a></p></aside>

Because I have this goal. And because I now am a fan of James Altucher, I bought Vaynerchuk’s book.

A series of connected pieces of free content that interested me, from respected sources, lead me buy some more content.

Good news for Gary. And I’m sure I’ll end up sending some money James’ way eventually. For now, my bus is coming and I have new socks to try on.
